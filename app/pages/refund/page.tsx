                request may not be entertained if the orders have been
                communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated

                In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report
                the same to our Customer Service team. The request will,

                determined the same at his own end. This should be reported
                within 7 Days days of receipt of the products. In case you feel
